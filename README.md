# lab-week2

ðŸŽ¯ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
I created a page where you can buy moon cookies, you can keep the updates and reset the game as well. you can also buy 10 cookies to get 10 on your scoreboard and 100 to get a 100 on it. I tried to style the button and make it transparent so the user doesnt have to see the border and I couldnt find a good combo of colours so I kept it transparent.
ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
I tried the best I could with the knowledge I have gained so far. I would say the thing I am not able to achieve at the current time is that I cannot work on a blank slate, With the help of Demo I could figure out what was next to come and how I can use that information and create my website better both visually and in code.
ðŸŽ¯ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I did not want to get too complicated with making more buttons and more code since I would not remember it fully so I did as much as I could remember for the time being and work on it even after the assignment is over.
